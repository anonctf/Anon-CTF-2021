# OSINT 1

In the challenge a username _B_Schwartzman_ is mentioned.<br>
[WhatsMyName](https://whatsmyname.app/) is a website that enumerates usernames across multiple social media accounts.<br><br>

https://twitter.com/B_Schwartzman is the twitter account that we'll get during enumeration.<br><br>

Reading the tweets carefully there is a mention of version control systems. The popular one is github.<br>
And there is also another possible username "John-B-Schwartzman".<br><br>

Enumerating this username gives us a github account https://github.com/John-B-Schwartzman<br>
There is a repository in that account which contains the flag.
